So one day Tinku was walking down the block. He was in the middle of Turkey running from the mob. The mob was after him for money. He hadn't payed up in months. He was soul searching in China and had just come back. As he was running he threw a pomegranate behind him in an attempt to deter his assailants. The pomegranate was effective and neutralized the threat. He ended up becoming Borat.

Despite being a famous journalist, Borat was still arrested for the murder of the people who were trying to mug him. The police had to collect all of the evidence that was left over from the crime, including every chunk of pomegranate that went flying in every direction when it struck the attacker's head. The police were quickly able to track down Borat and arrest him, because he is very load attracts a lot of attention. Little did the police know, being arrested was all part of Borat's master plan.
