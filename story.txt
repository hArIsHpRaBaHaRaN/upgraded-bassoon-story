So one day Tinku was walking down the block. He was in the middle of Turkey running from the mob. The mob was after him for money. He hadn't payed up in months. He was soul searching in China and had just come back. As he was running he threw a pomegranate behind him in an attempt to deter his assailants. The pomegranate was effective and neutralized the threat. He ended up becoming Borat.
